# Introduction to ML course
We take the Introduction to Machine Learning course at Innopolis University in the second year of our education. Innopolis University, located in Innopolis, Russia, is a leading institution renowned for its focus on technology, innovation, and computer science education. We have large assignments in this course, which I will post here.

This course necessitates a good understanding of Python, foundational math from both school and university levels, as well as familiarity with data libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib).


## Assignments during the course
**Format of the tasks:**

In each directory you will find two folders, one named 'Task description' which is just template that was given in assignments by the instructors. The other folder contains solution!

# Assignments description 
## Assignment 1
This assignment contains 3 unrelated parts. It's mainly about machine learning algorithms and their comparison.
#### Datasets: 
Datasets are already in **Assignment1 /Task description/** folder.
#### Models:
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- LogisticRegression (binary and multiclass)
- KNN 
- GNB 
#### Usage:
- Preprocess and analyze the data
- Train the above models to determine which one can achieve better results for each part of the assignment.
- Use GridSearch to brute force some hyperparameters of the model.
